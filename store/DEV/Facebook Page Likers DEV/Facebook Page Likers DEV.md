## 4. Facebook authentication 🔑 { argument }
Because the script will manipulate Facebook for you, it needs to be logged on your Facebook account. For that you just need to copy paste two session cookies in the script argument:
* Using Chrome, go to your Facebook homepage and open the inspector  
→ Right click anywhere on the page and select “Inspect” ![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/Inspect+browser.png)  
→ <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>OPT</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on macOS  
or  
→ <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>MAJ</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> on Windows

* Locate the “Application” tab

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet 📑
Below your session cookies you’ll find Spreadsheet URL.

Add in the Spreadsheet URL textbox the link of a Google spreadsheet with this same format **(Share option must be OPEN)**.

Your spreadsheet should contain a list of Facebook Pages URLs (**one link per row**).

You can specify the name of the column that contains the pages links. Simply enter the column name in the next text field.
You can also enter a single Facebook page URL directly in the field.


# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It’s done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

# Limits

Please be aware that this API, like most of our Facebook APIs, will manipulate your own account on your behalf. 

Facebook may notice unusual activities (login attemps from another location) and sometimes finds it suspicious and temporarily locks the account (asking to review the login to confirm it was intended).
