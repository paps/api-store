If you're operating from another browser and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/1-Spreadsheet.png)</center>

Add every linkedIn profiles link in column A (**one link per row**)

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a CSV file URL, it will work the same :)

## 6. Email discovery (optional) { email_discovery }

LinkedIn allows its users access to the email addresses of their 1st degree connections. 

However, if you’re looking for the email addresses of people you’re not connected to, picking an email discovery services is paramount.

As a Phantombuster user, you have a daily limit of email requests. (You can see that figure down below next to your execution time).

Use your credit by selecting "Phantombuster" as your email discovery service.

Already have a subscription with another data enrichment service such as [Dropcontact.io](https://dropcontact.io) or [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io)? Select a service and past your API key in the field below.

**Important note:** When email discovery is enabled, the API will open LinkedIn company pages to get company domains. For this reason, we recommend you limit your scraping to **40 profiles per day** if you're using it from a free LinkedIn account.


# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It’s done! Click on "launch" to start the extraction.

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

Phantombuster will do the busy work for you and visit LinkedIn on your behalf. After a while you will find yourself with all the data neatly organized in a .csv file. Feel free to import it in your CRM or use it as is.

# ⚙️️Repetition setup ⚙️ { repetition_setup }

Now that your API is ready, you should set up repetitive launches. That way, your scraping will be spread over days, weeks or even months.

Every time the API is launched, it will scrape 10 profiles and then stop. (This number can be changed in the configuration, the maximum is 100 per launch even though we don't recommend scraping so much.)

To do so, simply hit the “Settings” button to define when your API is launched:

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/settings-button.png)</center>

Then, select a frequency:

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/repetition-setup.png)</center>

Don't forget to click 💾 <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page!

For example, 10 profiles scraped per launch, 8 launches per day: you'll have a total of 80 profiles per day. We recommend not exceeding these values with this API. (Read more below about LinkedIn's limits.)


# Limits

**We recommend visiting a maximum of 80 profiles per day** if you have a free LinkedIn account. 

Visiting too many profiles often results in LinkedIn invalidating your session cookie (that is, logging you out). We recommend launching 4 launches a day and scrape 20 profiles.

If you have a Premium, Sales Navigator or Recruiter LinkedIn account, those rates are much higher. Please see these official LinkedIn help pages: [Commercial Use Limit](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950) and [Finding People on LinkedIn](https://premium.linkedin.com/professional/faq).

Last thing: When [email discovery](#section_email_discovery) is enabled, we recommend you divide any limit by 2 since the discovery service needs 2 requests to do its job (that is, **40 profiles per day**).
