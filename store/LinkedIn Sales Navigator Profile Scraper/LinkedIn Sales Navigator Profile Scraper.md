# Extract info from LinkedIn profiles

When building your CRM, you sometimes need to gather information from LinkedIn contacts/prospects. Don't waste your time copy/pasting anymore. Retrieve all the data you need of the specific LinkedIn profiles you're targeting in a CSV file.

# Our Solution

Launch an automated agent that will connect on LinkedIn as you. It will then browse and collect all the info from the designated profiles.

# What will you need? ⚙️ 

- **Session cookie**: Your session cookie from LinkedIn.
- **Spreadsheet URL**: The link of a Google Spreadsheet with LinkedIn Sales Navigator profile URLs (or regular profile URLs) in it.

_(**You already have all that?**  Click straight away on **"Use this API"**)_


# Which steps to follow?
## 1. Create an account on Phantombuster.com 💻

If you're operating from **another browser** and/or want to do it manually, [here is how to do it](https://intercom.help/phantombuster/help-home/how-to-get-your-cookies-without-using-our-browser-extension).

## 5. Add a Google Spreadsheet 📑
Below your session cookie you’ll find _Spreadsheet URL_

Enter in the text field a link of a Google Spreadsheet with this same format _(only column A is mandatory)_:
<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/1-Spreadsheet.png)</center>

Add every linkedIn profiles link in column A (**one link per row**)

**Please make sure your file is publicly accessible!**

You can also enter a CSV file URL, it will work the same :)

## 6. Email discovery (optional) { email_discovery }

LinkedIn allows its users access to the **email addresses** of their 1st degree connections. However, if you’re looking for the email addresses of people you’re not connected to, picking an email discovery services is paramount.

As a Phantombuster premium user, you have a daily credit of email requests. (You can see that figure down below next to your execution time).

Use your credit by selecting "Phantombuster" as your email discovery service.

**Already have a subscription with another data enrichment service** such as [Dropcontact.io](https://dropcontact.io) or [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io)? Select a service and past your API key in the field below.

**Important note:** When email discovery is enabled, the API will open LinkedIn company pages to get company domains. For this reason, we recommend you limit your scraping to **40 profiles per day** if you're using it from a free LinkedIn account.


# Click on Launch & Enjoy!
It’s done! All that is left to do is to click on "launch" to try your script!

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/launch.JPG)</center>

This will launch the bot and, if you didn't already change the spreadsheet URL, will collect the information of the Phantombuster team.

# ⚙️️Repetition setup ⚙️ { repetition_setup }

Now that your API is ready, you should set up repetitive launches. That way, your scraping will be spread over days, weeks or even months.

Every time the API is launched, it will scrape 10 profiles and then stop. (This number can be changed in the configuration, the maximum is 25 per launch.)

To do so, simply hit the “Settings” button to define when your API is launched:

<center>![](https://phantombuster.imgix.net/api-store/settings-button.png)</center>

Then, select a frequency:

Don't forget to click 💾 <span style="color:blue">Save</span> at the bottom of the page!

For example, 10 profiles scraped per launch, 8 launches per day: you'll have a total of 80 profiles per day. We recommend not exceeding these values with this API. (Read more below about LinkedIn's limits.)


# Limits

Please be aware that this API, like most of our LinkedIn APIs, will manipulate your own account on your behalf. 


# ⚙ ️HTTP API 🤓

If you want to use this API programmatically you can **replace** the argument **_spreadsheetUrl_** by **_profileUrls_** which must be an array of strings. Additionally, you should set **_noDatabase_** to `true` so that the API does not maintain a state on its own (so that you can re-scrape the same profiles).

It should look just like this :
`{ "profileUrls": ["www.linkedin.com/in/foo", "www.linkedin.com/in/bar"], "noDatabase": true, "sessionCookie": "xxxx" }`
